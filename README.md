# Registration Form

This project is a simple registration form built using HTML and JavaScript. It allows users to enter their name, email, password, date of birth, and accept terms and conditions. Upon submission, the entered data is displayed in a table below the form.

## Features

* **User-friendly registration form:** Includes input fields for name, email, password, date of birth, and a checkbox for accepting terms.
* **Real-time data display:** When a user submits the form, their information is immediately added as a new row to the "Registered Users" table.
* **Clear table headers:** The table displays the submitted data under the columns: Name, Email, Password, Dob (Date of Birth), and Accepted terms? (showing "true" or "false").
* **Basic styling:** The form and table are styled with CSS for better readability and visual appeal.
* **Responsive design:** The form adapts to smaller screen sizes.

## How to Use

1.  **Save the code:** Save the provided HTML code as an `.html` file (e.g., `index.html`).
2.  **Open in a browser:** Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.
3.  **Fill out the form:** Enter the required information in the respective input fields.
4.  **Accept terms:** Check the "Accept terms?" checkbox.
5.  **Click "Register":** Upon clicking the "Register" button, the submitted data will be added to the table below the form.

## File Structure

* `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure for the registration form and the table, along with the embedded CSS styling and JavaScript logic.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Potential Future Enhancements

* **Data persistence:** Currently, the data in the table is lost when the browser is refreshed. Implement local storage or a backend database to store the registered user data.
* **Form validation:** Add client-side validation to ensure users enter data in the correct format (e.g., valid email, strong password).
* **Password security:** In a real-world application, the password should be securely hashed before storing or displaying it.
* **Error handling:** Provide feedback to the user if there are any issues with the form submission.
* **More advanced styling:** Further enhance the visual design of the form and table.
* **Sorting and filtering:** Allow users to sort and filter the data in the "Registered Users" table.
